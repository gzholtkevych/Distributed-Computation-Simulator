The object of study is **Distributed Ledger Technology** (**DLT**).

Questions.

1. What is DLT?
    1. DLT understanding.
    2. What are the application areas of DLT?
    3. What are the benefits of using DLT?
    4. What are the difficulties of using DLT?
2. Give examples of network topologies oriented and unoriented rings based on [this text](https://github.com/gzholtkevych/Logical-Clock-in-Distributed-Ledgers/blob/main/Content/DLT.md). 
6. Global logical time problem for **D**istributed **L**edgers (**DL**).
7. Logical time for DL
   1.  based on oriented rings
   2.  based on unoriented rings
9. To be added.
